# Chrome Browser Addins and Configuration
This is a list of Chrome browser addins that I already use or think that I might find useful in the future or that 
I find awesome for some other reason. That's not to say that you would find them useful or even usable, 
this is only my opinion not a professional recommendation.
All of these applications work on Chrome for Windows 10.

### Secure Browsing
Browsing securely is quite a tall ask from any general purpose OS and browser.
These extensions and configuration should help.

- [WebRTC Network Limiter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webrtc-network-limiter/npeicpdbkakmehahjeeohfdhnlpdklia) - 
  WebRTC is an open media standard. However it leaks information such as your internal IP addresses and should be blocked if you want to stay
  completely secure.

- [uBlock Origin]() - a decent ad-blocker (many ads will grab detailed personal and tracking information so they need to be blocked anyway.
  It also has WebRTC blocking available as well as some tracking and malware blocking.

- [EFF Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) - specifically designed to block tracking tools. Very effective.

- [Vanilla Cookie Manager](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vanilla-cookie-manager/gieohaicffldbmiilohhggbidhephnjj/related?hl=en) - Cookies are often used to track browsing history, a cookie manager helps keep things clean.

- Some VPN providers such as VPN.AC have lightweight browser extensions that can be used instead of a full VPN network configuration. Use with the above extensions and
  additional configuration below.

- Protect against DNS leaks when using a VPN
- Do not enable Java use from the browser
- Make sure that sites cannot use your location
