### VPN's
A VPN encrypts *all* of the traffic going in and out of the network on your computer (or mobile). A global public VPN offers not only a private channel from your computer but also offers remote end points in various places around the world. That might be useful if you want to hide your actual location but is also useful as a traveller if you need maximum performance.


VPN's are particularly valuable when you connect to networks - especially Wi-Fi - here you cannot be sure of their security. Hotel and coffee shop Wi-Fi networks, for example, are notorious for serious security issues that can leak information but also allow malware to be inserted to your computer.

Sadly, you cannot trust all of the VPN reviews out there. Too many push services based on what everyone else says or by how much money they can make off advertising.
You can't trust all of the VPN services either. So choosing a good VPN is hard. You need to think carefully about your risks and about the features you really need.

- [VPN.ac](https://vpn.ac/) - Global public VPN service with some interesting features such as double-hop end points, availability in China (thanks to obfuscation features), mobile clients
  and a lightweight [browser extension (Chrome)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vpnac-secureproxy/kcndmbbelllkmioekdagahekgimemejo) for when a full VPN client might be too much. Reasonably priced with excellent performance, no logs kept. Reviews: [BestVPN (2017)](https://www.bestvpn.com/vpn-ac-review/), [Security Gladiators(2017)](https://securitygladiators.com/vpn-ac-review-burning-questions-answered/), [VPN Mentor (2017)](https://www.vpnmentor.com/reviews/vpn-ac/). Reviewers in the know seem to rate this
  service highly.

  It took me a long time to come to a decision but VPN.ac seem to provide a decent balance of security and capabilities, excellent performance, all at a very reasonable price.


### Deep Web Searches
These services may be useful for tracking down attackers, finding origins and particularly for discovering whether any of your own information
has leaked onto the Internet.

- [Pipl](https://pipl.com) - Useful site to track down people based on email names. Links to other sites for details, some of which are US only and/or paid services.
