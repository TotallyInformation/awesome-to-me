# Windows Applications to Avoid
This is a list of Windows applications that I will personally be avoiding! 
That's not to say that you might not find them useful or usable, 
this is only my opinion not a professional recommendation.

They show serious flaws of some kind. Perhaps being unstable, are insecure or maybe even just backed by dodgy morals.
