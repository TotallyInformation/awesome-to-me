# Awesome List of Windows Applications
This is a list of Windows applications already use or think that I might find useful in the future or that 
I find awesome for some other reason. That's not to say that you would find them useful or even usable, 
this is only my opinion not a professional recommendation.
All of these applications work on Windows 10.

### Other Lists

### Office
Tools for working with general business information.

- Microsoft Office - Love or hate it, it is the defacto standard and best of the bunch.

### Development
Tools to build or prototype other applications and services

- [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) - *"Build cross platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS"*

- [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Currently, my favourite code IDE and editor. 
   Has an [awesome list of its own](https://github.com/viatsko/awesome-vscode).

- [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/)
  Graphical, flow-based development tool. Originally developed at IBM to showcase MQTT and IoT.
  
  I've made some contributions to new nodes, the forums, documentation and I use this for my Home Automation setup.

- [TiddlyWiki](http://tiddlywiki.com/) - A reusable non-linear personal web notebook. 
  Also has standalone and mobile versions.

  Used this for some years not only as a notebook but also for weekly project reporting and other tasks. Also made some contributions
  to it. Great tool, a little complex to get your head round initially if you want to make full use of its capabilities.
  Basically wraps all the data and interactivity into a front-end html file with JavaScript doing the clever stuff.

### ETL, Data Cleansing and Manipulation
Tools to get hold of, alter and write out data (Extract, Transform, Load - ETL)

- Microsoft Excel - v2016 now contains [PowerQuery](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Introduction-to-Microsoft-Power-Query-for-Excel-6e92e2f4-2079-4e1f-bad5-89f6269cd605) which is a very powerful point & click (& query language) based data manipulation capability.
