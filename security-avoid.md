# Security and Privacy Services and Applications to Avoid
This is a list of applications and Web or Cloud services and systems that I will personally be avoiding due to security or privacy issues! 
That's not to say that you might not find them useful or usable, 
this is only my opinion not a professional recommendation.

They show serious security flaws of some kind or they have poor privacy implications.
You should also check out my other *avoid* lists so please check out the [master list](README.md).

### General
Nothing yet.

### Need Care
These applications and services require care in use. They are very likely to require careful configuration
to avoid privacy and security issues but are useful enough not to simply avoid.

You really *should* assume that *any* application or service requires care. When you start using something, check
how it communicates and what data is kept or transmitted. The [EFF Privacy Starter Pack](https://ssd.eff.org/en/playlist/want-security-starter-pack)
is a good place to start understanding how to stay safe. The UK's [National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/) and [ActionFraud](http://www.actionfraud.police.uk/) 
are two other useful places to find easy to consume resources on security.
