# Awesome List of Node.js Backend Modules
This is a list of backend (server-side) Node.js modules that I either already use or think that I might find useful in the future or that 
I find awesome for some other reason. That's not to say that you would find them useful or even usable, this is only my opinion not a 
professional recommendation.
