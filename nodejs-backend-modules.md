# Awesome List of Node.js Backend Modules
This is a list of backend (server-side) Node.js modules that I either already use or think that I might find useful in the future or that 
I find awesome for some other reason. That's not to say that you would find them useful or even usable, this is only my opinion not a 
professional recommendation.

### Other Lists

### Servers
Complete servers ready to use.
- [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/)
  Top of my list. Graphical, flow-based development tool. Originally developed at IBM to showcase MQTT and IoT.
  
  I've made some contributions to new nodes, the forums, documentation and I use this for my Home Automation setup.

- [TiddlyWiki](http://tiddlywiki.com/) - A reusable non-linear personal web notebook. Also has standalone and mobile versions.

  Used this for some years not only as a notebook but also for weekly project reporting and other tasks. Also made some contributions
  to it. Great tool, a little complex to get your head round initially if you want to make full use of its capabilities.
  Basically wraps all the data and interactivity into a front-end html file with JavaScript doing the clever stuff.

### Frameworks
Complex modules that can be used to build systems and services

### Applications
Complete client-side (front-end) applications built using Node.js (probably with the help of [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/))
- [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) - *"Build cross platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS"*
- [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Currently, my favourite code IDE and editor. Has an [awesome list of its own](https://github.com/viatsko/awesome-vscode).
